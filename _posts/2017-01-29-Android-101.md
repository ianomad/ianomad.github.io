It contains super basic overview of Android development.

It is based on the Linux kernel, so there are a huge variety of devices that can run Android, especially since it's open sourced. Android versions distribution:

There are multiple resources like [Google Documentation](https://developer.android.com) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), so I will try to concentrate on the main things here.

-----------------

## Main components of Android

The main components in Android Development are:

  - Activities (and Fragments)
  - Services
  - Content Providers
  - Broadcast Receivers

-----------------

### Activities (and Fragments)

My view on activities might be incorrect, but if you ever had experience working with MVC (model view controller) design pattern, activity is like controller, at least, it always seemed to me to be so. Although MVP (model view presenter) is heavily used nowadays by many developers, where activity left out to be at the view layer. Anyway, activity is responsible for creating the view, handling different states of it (like configuration changes, re-creation due to lack of memory, re-drawing, etc.).

### Services

Services are pretty much like classes that can run independently of the UI of the app, thus, for example, you can start a service on a boot of the device, and it will be running there forever doing some background job (like keep checking for updates, syncing local DB, etc.). Unlike iOS, this gives developers an opportunity to run whatever they want infinitely, and if it is used in a wrong way, it might affect things like battery life drastically.

### Content Providers

If you ever used an app that uses content of another app (for example, import friends in WhatsApp through Contacts which is another app), then this is due to help of Content Providers. They allow apps store information in a predefined contract and optionally export and give access to other apps. One of examples is choosing pictures in an app through gallery.

### Broadcast Receivers

Broadcast Receivers are used for listening to messages that run across all the apps (if they specify that want to listen which is explicitly declared in AndroidManifest.xml)
They are as well used for listening to Push Notifications which are constantly pulled by OS which is energy efficient, since you don't have to do it individually for every app by network calls.
