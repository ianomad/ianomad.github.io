# <strong>Getting Better at Reading (draft) </strong>

<br />
Couple of years ago I started reading more and while curiosity is large, my absorption is much
smaller in comparison with it. In this essay I am going to reflect on my strategies to read better.

<br />

### Why reading?

There are a lot of interesting things, and you can either watch, listen, or read. I choose
reading when I really want to focus on something, because it removes sounds, limits pictures, and
allows me to pace.

Reading could be done for entertainment, learning, or research. To be honest, I mostly read for
learning and very few for research. As for entertainment, I prefer watching or listening for now.

<br />

### Choosing a book

Choosing the right book is a critical decision and there are a few
techniques to maximize success.

**Motivation**. Why do you want to read a specific book? You kind of want to be honest whether the
topic is actually interesting to you.

**Scanning through the table of content**. Do those chapter titles catch your eye? Do you feel you
are being impatient to run through them? If yes, then it's probably a good book.

**Looking through the reviews**. Does it actually matter? If it's below 3.5 on GoodReads, probably
yeah... but that's also fighting with your curiosity, so you decide!

**Pacing and gaging curiosity**. Are you actually going to read those 1000+ pages by Dumas? I say
no.

<br />

### Absorbing the book (how)

**Table of contents is your friend**. I rely on the table of contents and it's my guiding friend.
It's kind of promises how exciting the book is going to be.

**Jumping between chapters**. Skip to something more interesting to you, but this probably doesn't
work with fiction? I mean, I don't read fiction anyway.

**Reminding yourself why you chose this book to gage focus**. I was falling asleep and then
remembered that if I didn't read that now, I will have trouble sleeping.

**Reading something you are familiar with already**. Ooh, this is like reading second half of Elon
Musk. I read most of that on Twitter during the past decade and the book was basically like a quick
rewind.

**Cozy & quite environment**. I mean, this kind of matters. I like silence and am typically easily
distracted.

**Phone, kindle, hard & paper covers**. I use them all and sometimes pay twice for the same book.

**Skipping, listening, quitting**. If the book is really not going forward, either I am unready for
it or the writer is bad! If it's the second sometimes I kind of get pissed about the wasted time.
Well, what can I do? He couldn't have predicted that.

<br />

### Should I have really read this?

**Finding answers to the long-standing questions.** Books can be very resourceful and I typically
really appreciate those writers. To be totally frank, I don't always understand their motivation and
such dedication. However, for me the answers are very precious, and they can clearly make
significant impact on your life.

**Happiness & satisfaction.** It kind of tingles my brain, especially if there are huge deep topics
that never made sense to be that are now put together like a solved puzzle. Besides happiness, often
times it makes me laugh.

**Speed, retention, depth.** It really depends, but does it really matter? My brain is insensitive
to names and dates, and generally it doesn't like details, unless I am really going to use that
information in any way.
