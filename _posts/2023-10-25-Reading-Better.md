## Reading Better (Draft V2)

<br />

I have been reading more for the past couple of years, and it's been kind of amazing. It just sort
of tingles my brain and I like this feeling. Now I decided to write about how I read; it just seems
like
another interesting experiment I want to try.

<br />

**Why read?**

Often times I impulsively buy many books on interesting topics, but when I think about
it deeply, the answer will be curiosity. I am trying to be selective though, there are many books I
don't end up liking. Also, I could watch or listen, but I choose to read for focus. There are no
sounds or motion picture; it's just you, text, and pacing. It's like black coffee.

<br />
**Choosing a book**

Ah, this is like the most important decision. It's gotta be interesting, you have to be ready for
it, and the book better not take your entire life to read. Picking the wrong
book is like that casual invite for a drink you shouldn't have accepted in the middle of the week,
you are gonna regret about it.

I mean, you have to be really honest about what's interesting to you instead of trying to be cool.
But don't you worry, choosing a good book is a skill, it takes time to shape. Take a look at the
table of contents, read through some reviews, think whether you want to give this book a chance.
When I see a good book, I become very impatient to start reading it, and often times some chapters
specifically. The more of them I like, the better.

<br />
**Absorbing the book**

Ooh, now it's getting exciting; you found something interesting that you actually want to
read. But wait, you don't want to ruin this, right? Patience is the virtue!

You are about to have this amazing time with the book, and there are just so many things which could
go wrong! Something could be bothering you, you are sleep-deprived, ate too
much or too little, something noisy around, low lighting or wrong temperature, or someone calling
you. I am not even gonna get into the social media apps.

Okay, you are ready now! We are officially entering the book's world guided by the table of contents
and the author tells you why this is going to be so amazing. You are passing through the
chapters impatiently paying full attention. While there are distractions, what you want to read in
the book is very personal to you, and you are now in a flight!

It comes with challenges: you don't understand some of the words, lose attention, or
have to postpone for another day. But then you remember why you chose the book, and you don't
want to leave it alone! Sometimes you have to jump straight to the chapter you want or buy the neck
light to spend more time reading during nights. You are pacing faster through what you already knew
or slowing down where there is stuff to learn.

You are now winning and nothing could be better than being here in the middle of the book in a cozy
warm seat with your brains tingling in silence! :3 :3 :3

Wait, I now had to travel for the holidays and forgot my book! It's too good, you are going to pay
for the digital version to read this on your phone! Finally, both you and the book made it to the
end. Hurray!

<br />

Hm... this is interesting though, how can I avoid the challenges above next time?

<br />

**Are you happy now?**

Oh, this holy fluid artifact of stored knowledge transcending through time of human evolution
exploding my mind! But wait, I kind of forgot most of the book (-_-). Although... I found some
answers to my questions, and learn that some just don't have the answers. Who cares! My
curiosity on this matter is satisfied! I will talk to my friends about this. Also, I need to mention
to my parents to read more.

<br />
**But I could have gone to the party!**

Hmm... yeah, you could. But how can you do both? I will think about it.
