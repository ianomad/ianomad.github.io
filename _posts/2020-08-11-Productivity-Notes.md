## <strong>Productivity Notes (Fundamentals) [WIP]</strong>
<br />

I define **productivity** as one's ability to deliver a certain output in a given time. If one has a goal, it is a distance reduction rate towards the goal, in a way similar to **speed**, but measured in tangible outcomes. There are several areas I want to leave a note on that represent basic fundamentals to high productivity in a healthy way.

### Happy Chemicals

Before I jump into practical basics, I want to give a high level overview of human brain chemicals[^1] that make us happy. Happiness is a good way to maintain sustainable productivity which can have an incremental improvements and exponential outcome in a reasonable period of time.

#### Dopamine

This is an addiction chemical (hormone) of the brain that make us a gambler of an achievement. Once set, we strive towards it and feel pleasure once we have achieved. Some great examples of dopamine is having a milestone and feeling accomplished after achieving it. It lasts for a period and will need to be reiterated with a new milestone. The milestones can be some project by a certain date or a long biking distance. The bigger the goal, the the bigger the dopamine shot is. It is a huge part of individual motivation.

#### Serotonin

Serotonin can mostly be described in the feeling of confidence in a certain ability. It is reinforced with more skill and capability. It's the sense of pride with yourself and others driving you even more. One good example would be social recognition for talent and effort. This is an important aspect from collective alignment perspective and is a way to validate that aspect, in my opinion.

#### Oxytocin

We feel this when hugging friends, family, and partners. In the feeling of friendship, love, safety, care, or that "Plan B" that we can always rely on as support if things go wildly wrong. It is a reliability aspect of survival and quite fundamental in collective alignment as well.

#### Endorphine

Finally, endorphine is a stress supressor. When one is jogging and injured their toe, they might not feel it until after the jogging is over. It makes perfect sense in the puzzle of survival, because if you are being chased my a tiger, you wouldn't wanna feel the pain until you are safe and brain helps us supress it.

### Nutrition

In order to manage the productivity and happiness, we need a reliabile nutrition as a base. There are various ways to achieve it, but in short it ends in healthy food and balanced weight.

#### Healthy food

Below is a sample note from my friend MD for **brain foods**.

- Fish like salmon (omega-3s and DHA has been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity)
- Nuts and nut butters (cashews, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, almonds)
- Healthy fats like avocado (like the actual fruit though switching to avocado oil is also beneficial)
- Dark chocolate (>70%)
- Eggs
- Blueberries and other berries
- Green leafy veggies like spinach
- Broccoli
- Cheese unless you’re lactose intolerant
- Yogurt but look for ones with no added sugars and higher protein content
- Caffeine maybe a cup of coffee in the morning otherwise if you need a boost in the afternoon it’s better to reach for matcha which has antioxidants and anti-stress/calming effect
- Green tea - see above; both green tea and matcha are good though matcha technically has high anti-oxidants and caffeine content. I think of it as a green tea shot with a couple extra added benefits
- Complex carbohydrates like whole wheat

- 🤸🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️🏊🏻‍♂️🧗🏻‍♂️🚴🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️ has a synergistic effect with diet

*Avoid simple carbs especially during the day which can make you sleepy/crash
*Junk foods with its high saturated fats and sucrose (sugar) have been shown reduce synaptic plasticity and reduce cognitive performance

**While there’s been data on the influence of nutrients on cognition, general consensus is still to maintain a balanced diet. My take is to eat well and supplement with more of the above, eliminate junk food/fast food/sugary beverages (as much as you can), and exercise regularly.

#### Balanced weight

In short, exercising and fasting.
