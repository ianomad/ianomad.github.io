### My Reading Journey


Several months ago (that is around beginning of June, 2019), I, all of a sudden, started reading books greedily. My urge to do so has been
<strong>unexpected</strong> to my family, friends, colleagues and, more importantly, to myself.

I will describe here what it has been like rather than reflecting on the trigger or the reason.

<br />

#### My reading before

I have always preferred to read informationally[^1] mostly online and found it to be very practical considering that I am a tech person. Mostly, I would look up for answers and best practices accompanied by some Youtube videos online. There were couple of books that were behind my shoulders like Perfumer[^2], The Art of War[^3], a bunch of productivity books, etc. These were mild readings, because I have always thought that practical knowledge is <strong>more important</strong>. Was I wrong?? I think so...

<br />

#### Reading for the last couple of months

In this section, I am going to reflect changes that happened to me after.

<br />

##### Change 1: Concentration

The number one change that happened in the beginning was an ability to <strong>concentrate</strong>, ability to <strong>track multiple points</strong>, <strong>articulate</strong> them, and derive more <strong>conscious decisions</strong>. It's important to mention that I never had issues with the latter, but I have observed a considerable change that should be mentioned as the first bullet point.

<br />

##### Change 2: Ideology

I have been reading pretty intensively (like 2-5 books a week) and visited areas like Philosophy
(Kant[^4], Nietzsche[^5], Lao Tzu[^6], Bruce Lee[^7], etc.), Business (Explosive Growth[^8], Good to Great[^9], etc.), Marketing, Psychology, Media, Behavioral Economics, etc..


By Ideology, I mean my stance on where I am, why I am here, what I am doing, how I am doing it, and so on and so forth.

<br />

##### Change 3: Understanding

Understanding has been another ability that I saw an improvement on. My outlook, as it has been broadened by the minds that wrote the books I read, now can look at things from different perspectives and even though I cannot have every view, I am more <strong>aware</strong> than I was before.


<br />

I am still working on this article...
