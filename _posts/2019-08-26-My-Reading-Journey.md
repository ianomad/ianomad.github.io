### My Reading Journey


A few months ago I started reading books greedily and the reason for the desire to read is not really clear to me.

However, in this essay I will describe what it's been like and without much introspection on why I wanted to read. However, the desire to read is not caused by some kind of existential crisis, but rather curiosity and a strong desire to know.

<br />

#### My reading before

I have always preferred to read informationally[^1] mostly online and found it to be very practical considering that I am a tech person. Mostly, I would look up for answers and best practices accompanied by some Youtube videos online. There were couple of books that were behind my shoulders like Perfumer[^2], The Art of War[^3], and others for productivity, psychology, etc. These were mild readings, because I have always thought that practical knowledge is <strong>more important</strong>. Was I wrong?? I think so...

<br />

#### Reading for the last couple of months

In this section, I am going to reflect changes that happened to me after.

<br />

##### Change 1: Concentration

The number one change that happened in the beginning was an ability to <strong>concentrate, ability to track multiple points, articulate them, and derive more conscious decisions</strong>. It's important to mention that I never had issues with any of the mentioned, but I have observed a considerable change that should be mentioned as the first bullet point.

<br />

##### Change 2: Ideology

I have been reading pretty intensively (like 2-5 books a week) and visited areas like Philosophy
(Kant[^4], Nietzsche[^5], Lao Tzu[^6], Bruce Lee[^9], etc.), Business (Explosive Growth[^10], Good to Great[^11], etc.), Marketing (Contagious[^13], Letting go of the words[^14]), Psychology (Man's Search for Meaning[^15]), Media (Flat Earth News[^16]), Behavioral Economics (Predictably Irrational[^17]), etc..


By Ideology, I mean my stance on <strong>what I am doing</strong>, <strong>where I am doing it</strong>, <strong>how I am doing it</strong>.

It's really hard to summarize, but to make a point, it mostly means a somewhat concentrated awareness of my physical and virtual location (law of the nature[^4]), my life goals (logic[^4]), and my style (ethics[^4]) in the realm of the changing world and time.

<br />

##### Change 3: Understanding

Understanding has been another ability that I saw an improvement on. My outlook, as it has been broadened by the minds that wrote the books I read, now can look at things from different perspectives and even though I cannot have every view, I am more <strong>aware</strong> than I was before.

Again, to make it simple, I started paying more attention to <strong>people's opinions, things happening around me, and pretty much everything</strong>, because, for the most part, I can relate it to something I have read before.


<br />

##### Change 4: Detachment from bias

It's very important to share this point. We live in a daily routine of expectations and analogies, which is not necessarily bad. However, for one trying to do something unordinary in the shortness of life[^12] or simply live a more conscious life, <strong>ability to withstand the expectation, stay away from bias, and derive reason or gut feeling based judgement</strong> is quite vital to align with your true desires.


<br />

##### Change 5: Other

There is a whole bunch and I will edit this article as I explore and have time to write.

<br />

#### Conclusion

<strong>My point is simple: read more</strong>.

I am not a fanatical writer, so, I am not putting every thought down in a blast of articles. The expectation from my journey though is to apply the knowledge I obtain in my social capacity, although the points above already prove it happened to some extend.
